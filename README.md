# BTS Financial In N Out

## Description
Website: https://symmetrical-couscous-1.onrender.com/ <br>
BTS My Precious is a financial tracker website, that allows the user to input data about their finances. <br>
We thought of designing a web application that could be useful to an audience who wants to keep track of their income and expenses. <br>
With My Precious, the user will be able to easily track money coming in and out of their accounts. Allowing the user to be mindful of their future goals, by knowing how much they are spending vs how much they are making. <br>
By developing this full stack application, we learned how the front end and back end compliment each other to create a useful tool with a full user experience.

To run the server inside PSQL you need to do an "npm install" to download all npm packages used. <br>
After installing all npm packages you will need to login to PSQL by using "PSQL -U postgres" and entering you username and password. <br>
Once logged in to PSQL you can run the command "\i schema.sql" to create the finance_db database. <br>
By running the script "seed" you can have some default information to test GET, POST, and DELETE routes through Insomnia or thunder client inside VS code.
